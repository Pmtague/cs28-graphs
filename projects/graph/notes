Breadth-First Traversal Algorithm

Add starting node to a queue

While queue isn't empty:
	Dequeue the first vert
	If that vert isn't visited:
		Mark as visited
		Add all its unvisted neighbors to the queue



Depth-First Traversal Algorithm

Add starting node to a stack

While stack isn't empty:
	Pop the first vert
	If that vert isn't visited:
		Mark as visited
		Push all its unvisted neighbors to the stack
